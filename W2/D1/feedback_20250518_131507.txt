suggestions for improvement:
- In the `Cat` class, the `oldest_cat` method should not be an instance method but a function outside the class, aligning with the exercise instructions.  The function should take a list of `Cat` objects as input.
- The `Dog` class correctly implements the methods as instructed. The size comparison is also accurate.
- The `Song` class functions as specified.
- The `Zoo` class largely meets the requirements. However, the `get_animals` method should print the animals in a user-friendly format (e.g., with each animal on a new line).  The `__init__` method of `Zoo` has an unnecessary argument, `zoo_name` should be the only one.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The Cat exercise's solution has a correctness issue: the `oldest_cat` method is implemented as an instance method within the `Cat` class rather than a separate function that takes a list of `Cat` objects as input, as the instructions specified. The Dog, Song, and Zoo classes are mostly correct, with minor issues mentioned in the feedback section, and are largely compliant with the instructions.  The zoo class successfully adds, removes, sorts and groups animals.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive.  Minor improvements could be made to make the code flow even better (such as restructuring the `Cat` exercise to have a standalone function).
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the tasks involved. The algorithms used (sorting, searching) have reasonable time complexity.  No major performance bottlenecks are present.
- security: There are no apparent security vulnerabilities in the provided code. The code is purely functional and does not interact with external systems or user input in a way that could introduce security risks.
